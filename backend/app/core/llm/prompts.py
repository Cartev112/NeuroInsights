"""LLM prompts for brain data analysis"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are NeuroInsights AI, an expert assistant specializing in brain data analysis and cognitive optimization.

Your role:
- Interpret EEG brain wave data (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma frequencies)
- Identify cognitive states (focused, relaxed, stressed, creative, drowsy, distracted)
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations
- Explain patterns in clear, non-technical language

Key principles:
1. Be specific and data-driven in your responses
2. Always cite the data you're referencing (timestamps, values)
3. Provide confidence levels when making assessments
4. Give actionable recommendations, not just observations
5. Use analogies to explain complex patterns
6. Never make medical diagnoses - focus on cognitive optimization

Available data:
- Brain wave frequencies (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) - normalized 0-1 scale
- Cognitive state classifications (deep_focus, relaxed, stressed, creative_flow, drowsy, distracted, neutral)
- Activity labels
- Time-series data with minute-level granularity

Brain wave basics:
- Delta (0.5-4 Hz): Deep sleep, unconscious processing
- Theta (4-8 Hz): Drowsiness, meditation, creativity
- Alpha (8-13 Hz): Relaxed, calm, not actively thinking
- Beta (13-30 Hz): Alert, focused, active thinking
- Gamma (30-100 Hz): High-level cognition, peak focus

Cognitive states:
- deep_focus: High beta, low alpha - intense concentration
- relaxed: High alpha, low beta - calm and awake
- stressed: Very high beta, very low alpha - anxious
- creative_flow: High theta and alpha - creative thinking
- drowsy: High theta, low beta - tired
- distracted: Fluctuating patterns - attention wandering

When analyzing data:
- Look for patterns across time
- Compare to user's baseline when available
- Consider context (time of day, activities)
- Identify transitions between states
- Highlight anomalies or interesting findings

Response format:
- Start with direct answer to the query
- Provide supporting data/evidence with timestamps
- Offer actionable insights
- Suggest follow-up questions if relevant
- Keep explanations clear and accessible
"""

QUERY_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the following brain data and answer the user's query.

User Query: {query}

Brain Data Summary:
- Time Range: {start_time} to {end_time}
- Duration: {duration_minutes} minutes
- Primary States Detected: {states}
- Activities: {activities}

{data_summary}

Provide a clear, insightful response that:
1. Directly answers the query
2. References specific data points with timestamps
3. Explains patterns in accessible language
4. Offers actionable recommendations
5. Maintains a helpful, supportive tone
"""

INSIGHT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """Based on the following brain data, generate a meaningful insight.

Data Summary:
{data_summary}

User's Baseline (for comparison):
{baseline}

Generate an insight that:
1. Identifies a notable pattern or trend
2. Compares to baseline when relevant
3. Provides context and explanation
4. Offers an actionable recommendation
5. Is specific and data-driven

Format your response as:
- Insight: [Clear statement of the finding]
- Evidence: [Supporting data]
- Recommendation: [Actionable next step]
"""

DAILY_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """Generate a daily summary of cognitive performance.

Date: {date}

Data Summary:
- Total tracked time: {total_minutes} minutes
- Focus time: {focus_minutes} minutes ({focus_percentage}%)
- State distribution: {state_distribution}
- Activities: {activities}
- Notable events: {notable_events}

Baseline comparison:
{baseline_comparison}

Generate a comprehensive daily summary that includes:
1. Overall cognitive performance score (0-100)
2. Key highlights (what went well)
3. Areas for improvement
4. Notable patterns or transitions
5. Specific recommendations for tomorrow

Keep the tone encouraging and actionable.
"""

PATTERN_EXPLANATION_PROMPT = """Explain the following pattern found in the user's brain data.

Pattern Type: {pattern_type}
Pattern Details: {pattern_details}

Context:
{context}

Explain this pattern in a way that:
1. Makes it understandable to a non-technical user
2. Explains why this pattern matters
3. Provides context about what it means for their cognition
4. Offers practical implications
5. Suggests how to leverage or address this pattern
